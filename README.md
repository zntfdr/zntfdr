# Hi! Federico here 👋🏻

I'm a software engineer that has found a new home in South East Asia, currently enjoying my time in Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭. I build products for Apple platforms, and have a strong passion for Swift, minimalism, and design. When I'm not busy automating things, you can find me writing at [fivestars.blog][fs] and/or playing with the latest shiny toys ✨.
